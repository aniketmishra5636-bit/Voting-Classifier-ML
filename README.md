#  Voting Classifier Machine Learning Project

###  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the power of **Ensemble Learning** by combining multiple Machine Learning models into a single **Voting Classifier**. By aggregating the predictions of different algorithms, we achieve better accuracy and more stable results.

###  Key Highlights
* **Model Type:** Voting Classifier (Ensemble)
* **File Format:** Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
* **Technique:** Hard/Soft Voting integration.

###  Tech Stack Used
* **Python**
* **Scikit-Learn**
* **Pandas & NumPy**

###  Conclusion
The ensemble approach successfully reduced individual model errors and provided a more robust final prediction.
